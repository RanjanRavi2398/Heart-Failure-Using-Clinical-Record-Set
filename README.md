# Heart-Failure-Using-Clinical-Record-Set
In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from using academic performance data. The list of tasks below : 
1) Data Preparation and Exploration 
2) Data standardization 
3) Splitting the dataset into Train and Test (8:2 Combinations and use 10 â€“fold cross validation) 
4) Predict the accuracy of classifier and evaluate them. 
5) plot the graph 
6) Calculate the computational complexity of the model

# Source of dataset:
 Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.
