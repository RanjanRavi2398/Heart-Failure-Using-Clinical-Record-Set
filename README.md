# Heart-Failure-Using-Clinical-Record-Set
In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from using academic performance data. The list of tasks below : 
1) Data Preparation and Exploration 
2) Data standardization 
3) Splitting the dataset into Train and Test (8:2 Combinations and use 10 â€“fold cross validation) 
4) Predict the accuracy of classifier and evaluate them. 
5) plot the graph 
6) Calculate the computational complexity of the model
